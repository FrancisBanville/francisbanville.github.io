Predicting food webs across space while correctly reflecting their uncertainty is an important goal of network ecology. We took a probabilistic metaweb (a network of potential feeding relationships) for Canada, broke it down into localized units, and propagated the uncertainty of species interactions to highlight areas with uncertain network compositions (black holes) and areas with reliable ones (revelations). The aim of this working group was to identify priority sampling locations for interaction data that would be the most efficient at reducing uncertainty in network predictions.

##### 1. Assembling, predicting and refining a predator-prey metaweb for Canada 
With the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution ([CIEE](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/))\
January 2021 ‑ March 2022 (*virtual* )\

[{{< fa file-pen >}} Food web reconstruction through phylogenetic transfer of low-rank network representation](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13835)](metaweb_transfer.jpg)

There are large gaps in our knowledge of the predator-prey interactions that make up food webs, and Canada is no exception. This working group built the first Canadian metaweb of trophic interactions between tetrapods, which documents all of the potential trophic interactions at the national scale. To do so, we predicted potential feeding interactions by leveraging information from the European metaweb using phylogenetic relationships as a medium for transfer.
