Networks of **species interactions**, such as networks of predators and prey commonly called **food webs**, drive the functioning of ecosystems and determine their response to environmental changes. It can be difficult (or even impossible) to observe every interaction in a given environment. Yet, understanding these interactions is fundamental if we want to adequately protect ecosystems worldwide. This creates important ecological **data gaps** that can be partially filled using **numerical predictions**. My research focuses on the development of statistical and mathematical models for predicting those predator-prey relationships and some key emerging network properties in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Specifically, my main research project uses **maximum entropy** to predict the structure of food webs on a global scale. Take a look at the projects and publications pages to know more!

[![A wasp lies caught on a spider web. Both animals are predators that must eat other animals to live; in this case, the wasp may or may not become food for the spider. How certain is this interaction between species? We can think of this uncertainty as a probability, and the aggregate of all such interactions among organisms in one place as a statistical distribution.
