# Resources

This is a short list of resources that I find useful.

- 3Blue1Brown and StatQuest channels, which, respectively, explain university-level concepts in mathematics and statistical methods, including machine learning and deep learning methods. 

- Richard McElreathâ€™s book on Bayesian inference is an accessible textbook that was a bit help to me in learning statistics.
