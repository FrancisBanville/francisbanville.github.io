# About

### {{< fa heart >}} My values 

Safeguarding the **quality of the environment** for the benefits of humans and animals is something close to my heart, as are issues of **equity, diversity and inclusion** in academia and beyond. I am committed to making science more **open and comprehensible** to the general public. This to me is fundamental to addressing the greatest challenges of our time: climate change and the biodiversity crisis. To this end, I also support economic degrowth and am moving towards a more sustainable lifestyle by reducing my carbon footprint through minimalist habits and limited plane travels.

### {{< fa person-hiking >}} My academic journey

After spending nearly two years studying mathematics, I decided to switch to biology. I wanted to deepen my understanding of the environmental issues we face today. A little later, I eventually merged these two interests by starting a professional master’s in quantitative and computational biology. This enabled me to develop my programming skills and familiarize myself with the use of digital methods in ecology. These skills were invaluable to me when I started my scientific journey as a PhD student in biology.

It shows how the temporal dynamics of a three-species food chain slowly takes the shape of an alluring tea cup. ](pictures/about/figure2D.gif){width=300}](https://zenodo.org/record/4022518#.ZDq_A3ZBy3A)


### {{< fa leaf >}} My coding motivations

Along my academic journey, I understood that ecology could benefit from digital intelligence by making it easier for us to study complex ecological systems. I had done very little programming before my graduate studies, so at first I shuddered at the prospect of writing a few lines of code. Then I gradually got my hands dirty, and coding is now something I really enjoy! Another motivating factor for me to work in digital intelligence is the welcoming and open community of researchers.

### {{< fa circle-nodes >}} My research 

Networks of **species interactions**, such as networks of predators and prey commonly called **food webs**, drive the functioning of ecosystems and determine their response to environmental changes. It can be difficult (or even impossible) to observe every interaction in a given environment. Yet, understanding these interactions is fundamental if we want to adequately protect ecosystems worldwide. This creates important ecological **data gaps** that can be partially filled using **numerical predictions**. My research focuses on the development of statistical and mathematical models for predicting those predator-prey relationships and some key emerging network properties in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Specifically, my main research project uses **maximum entropy** to predict the structure of food webs on a global scale. Take a look at the projects and publications pages to know more!

[![A wasp lies caught on a spider web. Both animals are predators that must eat other animals to live; in this case, the wasp may or may not become food for the spider. How certain is this interaction between species? We can think of this uncertainty as a probability, and the aggregate of all such interactions among organisms in one place as a statistical distribution.

### {{< fa heart-circle-check >}} My priorities

As graduate students, we often tend to neglect our **mental and physical health**. Yet, maintaining the right work-life balance is one of the most important keys to success in grad school. It can’t be overstated: it’s important to eat well, get enough sleep and exercise, and have hobbies, especially when writing a PhD thesis. In my spare time, I’ve become an avid walker, an occasional jogger, and an amateur but committed ping-pong player! Universities offer psychological help, social support, and physical care to students in need. At the University of Montreal, the [Services à la vie étudiante](https://vieetudiante.umontreal.ca/) offers many tools that greatly helped me throughout my academic journey.
