    "text": "I am a PhD candidate in ecology based in Montreal, Quebec (also known as the bonjour-hi city). I study complex systems such as food webs and other ecological networks using mathematical and probabilistic models. Specifically, I predict the structure of aquatic and terrestrial food webs on a global scale using entropy to better understand what drives trophic interactions at the community level. Considering that winter temperature can be as low as -30 °C in Montreal, my research interests in maximizing the entropy of ecological networks could stem from repressed feelings and desires for warmth."
