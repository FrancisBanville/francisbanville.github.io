(2023, March 16-17)\n33rd Biology Symposium of the University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada\n event\n\n\n\nI was part of the student committee in charge of organizing the 33rd symposium of the department of biological sciences of the University of Montreal. This event aims to promote students’ research in the department and dedicates its annual theme to key contemporary scientifical and societal questions. We invited keynote speakers and organized a round table on the issues of subjectivity and complexity in science. We also organized a fully vegetarian buffet for more than 200 ravenous participants with waste minimization in mind. Picture credit: Tanya Strydom.\n\n\n\n\n1.

How to estimate network structure without data\nBanville, F., MacDonald, A., Gravel, D., & Poisot, T. (2019, December 18-20)\n10th Annual QCBS Symposium, Montreal, Qc, Canada\n event,  slides\n\n\n\nThat was my first scientific talk! I presented our framework to predict food-web structure across space using simple food-web models and data on species richness, without using species interactions data. Since then, our framework greatly evolved, going from mechanistic ecological models to maximum entropy. I remember listening to Les Antipodes (the new album of Les Cowboys Fringants) on loop (and quite loudly to the detriment of my eardrums) as a stress coping mechanism before presenting.\n\n\n\n\n\nLightning talks\n\n4. Interactions entre espèces : une histoire d’écologie et de hasard\nBanville, F., Gravel, D., & Poisot, T. (2022, March 29)\nMy IVADO research project in 180 seconds, Montreal, Qc, Canada\n event,  slides,  video\n\n\n\nA fascinating predator-prey food web flourishes in the Lion King universe, where insects were opportunistically incorporated into a lion’s diet after a drastic change in its lifestyle. Could this exceptional interaction have been anticipated? To document feeding interactions across large spatial and temporal scales, we often need to rely on statistical models, which are more powerful when the structure of the entire food web is known beforehand. The principle of maximum entropy can help us reconstruct the emerging structure of food webs by finding the most complex network configuration given prior ecological information about that system.\n\n\n\n\n3.

I ended up presenting virtually three packages built by the Poisot Lab (Mangal.jl, EcologicalNetworks.jl and EcologicalNetworksPlots.jl) to analyze and visualize species interaction networks in Julia. I’m still dreaming about Lisbon’s beaches to this day.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosters\n\n2. Given limited knowledge, what can we say about a food web’s properties?\nBanville, F., Gravel, D. & Poisot, T. (2021, December 8-10)\n12th Annual QCBS Symposium, virtual\n event,  poster\n\n\n1. Trophic-METE: A parsimonious theory of food-web structure\nBanville, F., Gravel, D. & Poisot, T. (2020, December 14-16)\n11th Annual QCBS Symposium, virtual\n event,  poster\n\n\n\nThe structure of food webs can be derived using known ecological information such as the total numbers of species, interactions, and individuals, as well as the network’s area and total energy transfer. These variables constrain the space of feasible networks by narrowing down the number of plausible configurations. Although the project of building a maximum entropy theory of food-web structure based on these five variables is still a work in progress, we were able to develop a robust framework to predict food-web structure based solely on the total numbers of species and interactions."

Black holes and revelations: Identifying priority sampling locations for local food webs in Canada\nWith the Computational Biodiversity Science & Services program (BIOS²)\nSeptember 2022 (Montreal, Canada)\n repo,  BiodiversityObservationNetworks.jl\n\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Christopher Brimacombe, me, Hana Mayall, Gabriel Dansereau, Timothée Poisot, Penelope Blyth, and Gracielle Higino.\n\n\nPredicting food webs across space while correctly reflecting their uncertainty is an important goal of network ecology. We took a probabilistic metaweb (a network of potential feeding relationships) for Canada, broke it down into localized units, and propagated the uncertainty of species interactions to highlight areas with uncertain network compositions (black holes) and areas with reliable ones (revelations). The aim of this working group was to identify priority sampling locations for interaction data that would be the most efficient at reducing uncertainty in network predictions.\n \n\n\n2.

This working group built the first Canadian metaweb of trophic interactions between tetrapods, which documents all of the potential trophic interactions at the national scale. To do so, we predicted potential feeding interactions by leveraging information from the European metaweb using phylogenetic relationships as a medium for transfer."

    "text": "Understanding how different species interact within ecological networks can be quite difficult. To observe these interactions in nature, we need to observe both species at the same time and place, which is not always easy. Even if two potentially interacting species come across each other, it does not mean that they will interact. For example, a predator might not be feeling hungry when meeting its prey. If the predator gets hungry later and decides to go hunting, the researcher might not notice this interaction happening. This leads to many interactions going unnoticed, leaving important gaps in our knowledge of species interactions. Additionally, the expensive process of sampling interactions adds to this challenge by leaving many environments without any collected data. In this context, ecologists must rely on computer-based methods to fill in these knowledge gaps and verify if the data we have might have missed some interactions (known as false negatives). In this project, we develop different ways to predict species interactions using available ecological information."

We show how to estimate the parameters of this distribution with accuracy, while respecting the biological constraints of real food webs.

Forecasting the diversity of warbler species\nWith the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON)\nMay - August 2021 (Montreal, Canada)\n BIOS² first blog post (also posted here),  BIOS² second blog post,  repo\n\n\n\nOur predictions suggest that warbler communities are likely to become less unique (more homogeneous) in the south of Quebec in the upcoming years, in contrast with the north. In Colombia, we predicted that the Andes Mountains will continue to host unique and rich warbler communities. Animated figure created in collaboration with fellow interns Gabriel Dansereau and Samuel Provencher-Tardif.\n\n\nThe aim of our internship was to test a framework to generate machine-learning based forecasts of meaningful biodiversity indicators under different socio-economic scenarios. We built a forecasting model of beta-diversity in Quebec and Colombia, two states with completely different environments and sociopolitical contexts. More precisely, we integrated biodiversity and environmental data from different sources to forecast local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD) indices of wood-warbler species across space. LCBD indices measure the uniqueness of a site (or gird cell) in terms of species composition and can help environmental managers identify places with high biodiversity value. Once implemented, this framework could guide conservation efforts by efficiently generating real-time reports on the current and anticipated states of biodiversity on a global scale.\n \n\n\n1.

Participants worked on a personal project using the programming language of their choice between Python, R, and Julia. Our role was to organize a full day of workshops for beginners and intermediate learners and support them in the completion of their projects. I gave an introductory workshop on machine learning and ecological network analysis in Julia. I was pleasantly surprised by the commitment and motivation of our data trekkers despite the outbreak of the pandemic. That was the first edition of the event. Having had such a positive experience, I gladly volunteered to mentor participants once again in the third edition."

    "text": "Artificial intelligence can be used to classify the full set of predation relationships within a biological community. Without it, such a task would be difficult if not inconceivable. Networks made up of predators and their prey are core elements in the operation and stability of every ecosystem, and can be reconstituted based on the total number of species present. But for what purpose? To better protect them. \n\nBluefin tuna is a staple of the diets of millions of people. It feeds mainly on small fish, which in turn feed on plankton. The decline of a one species within that food chain could have dramatic consequences for bluefin populations, which are already severely affected by commercial fishing. This is a simplified illustration, however, and it paints a somewhat misleading ecological picture. Every biological community comprising a given set of species, aquatic or terrestrial, actually includes multiple interconnected food chains, which, taken together, amount to a network. Such networks, weakened because of human activity, underpin the workings of all ecosystems.\nWithin these so-called trophic networks, or food webs, two species are linked if they interact. Predators derive energy from feeding on their prey, and through that energy, they play a crucial role in maintenance of the benefits we as humans receive from the environment. Those benefits are indispensable, of course: food chains provide considerable services to humankind every year. To that end, proper protection of ecosystems requires a thorough understanding of their trophic networks. Accounting for all the interactions between species in a given place, however, demands considerable human and financial resources. For example, determining whether a jackal interacts with an antelope in a given natural setting may require several hours of painstaking work. Data collected on trophic networks are therefore limited, posing a major obstacle to studying them on a large scale.\nThe objective of my research project, given the scarcity of data on predation relationships, is to develop a method for predicting how interactions in a trophic network are organized. To do so, I use the total number of species within a biological community, which is by far the most studied and quantified measure of biodiversity in ecology. Estimates of total species counts in a network are generally accurate, even when not all species have been identified.\nMyriad ecological issues can therefore be explored without knowing the exact identity of predators and prey. Ecologists often focus on the way interactions are organized within a biological community to understand how it functions. For example, an invasive species generally has more difficulty becoming part of a network in which species interact a lot with each other; that is, a network that is virtually saturated with interactions. The total number of interactions in a network is thus a primary source of information about its stability and resilience to natural disruptions. Many other aspects of trophic network structure are also factors in the functioning of biological communities; for example, the presence of groups of species whose members interact extensively with each other. By accurately predicting the structure of food webs, we can thus better study the consequences of environmental disasters on the functioning of ecosystems.\nThe number of species is a fundamental measure of any trophic network, as it is also closely associated with the total number of interactions. A community with a high number of species typically has an even higher number of interactions. With my research team, I modelled this association while controlling for ecological constraints on the minimum and maximum number of interactions. For example, a community composed exclusively of a herbivore that feeds on a few plant species would have the minimum number of interactions, while one made up of cannibalistic carnivores—that is, a community saturated in interactions—would have the maximum number of interactions. Between these two extremes, a fraction of the potential interactions occurs. We therefore modelled the probability that a given interaction would happen.\nAfter a large number of simulations, we obtained the total number of predicted interactions within a network. As an example, take Mount Royal Park, on the Island of Montréal. According to the group Les amis de la montagne (friends of the mountain), it is home to no fewer than 700 plant species, 180 avian species, and 20 mammalian species. The total number of interactions in this trophic network made up of 900 species, approximately 65,000, can be predicted using our model.\nAlthough the total number of interactions is itself informative, it is also linked to the way in which those interactions are organized within a given network. The next phase of my research project will therefore harness the results obtained thus far to more specifically predict the organizational structure of the links within a trophic network based on the number of species and the predicted number of interactions. The significant biodiversity loss resulting from environmental disasters may drastically alter the functioning of ecosystems by modifying the structure of their trophic networks. I therefore aim to use the results of my project to pave the way for better simulation of the consequences of climate change and natural-habitat destruction on trophic networks, so as to identify effective measures for limiting those harmful impacts.\n\nThis article was produced by me with the guidance of Marie-Paule Primeau, science communication advisor, as part of IVADO’s “My research project in 800 words” initiative.\nFind some of my videos on IVADO’s Youtube channel!\n Mon projet de recherche IVADO en 800 mots\n First Estimates of Food Web Structure Derived from Species Richness\n Octobre Numérique IVADO 2020\nThe original version of this blog post can be found on IVADO’s website.

    "text": "About\n\n My values\nMy work is firmly rooted in the principles of reproducibility and open science. I am dedicated to making my research transparent and sharing my data, scripts, and results with the broader community whenever possible. Acknowledging the potential environmental and human impacts of scientific research, I am mindful that data science can lead to harm through the misuse of data and algorithms and the high energy and resource consumption of research endeavors. Additionally, I recognize the colonial roots of western scientific methods and practices and the risk to exacerbate social inequalities through scientific work. To mitigate these harms, I am committed to educating myself on these issues and fostering a more respectful, diverse, and inclusive environment. I firmly believe that science, guided by strong intersectional feminist principles, should be harnessed to improve our lives and oriented towards finding solutions to pressing global challenges such as climate change and the preservation of natural habitats, all the while being cognizant of our contribution to circles of oppression. By attentively listening to the needs and concerns of our community, we can ensure that science remains relevant and truly meaningful.\n\n\n My academic journey\nAfter spending nearly two years studying mathematics, I decided to switch to biology. I wanted to deepen my understanding of the environmental issues we face today. A little later, I eventually merged these two interests by starting a professional master’s in quantitative and computational biology. This enabled me to develop my programming skills and familiarize myself with the use of digital methods in ecology. These skills were invaluable to me when I started my scientific journey as a PhD student in computational biology.\n\n\n\nI made this hypnotizing GIF in one of my master’s projects, in which my teammates and I reproduced the classical paper of Hastings and Powell (1991). It shows how the temporal dynamics of a three-species food chain slowly takes the shape of an alluring tea cup.\n\n\nDuring my academic journey, I came to realize the potential of integrating digital intelligence into ecology, as it makes it easier for us to study complex ecological systems. I had done very little programming before my graduate studies and the idea of writing code seemed daunting. However, as I delved deeper into my studies, I embraced the challenge and gradually developed a genuine appreciation for coding. It has now become something I thoroughly enjoy!\n\n\n My research\nTo adequately protect our natural environments, the present state of biodiversity must be thoroughly described and understood. To do so, it is essential to comprehend how different species interact with each other, as this has a big impact on how nature works. For example, many animals depend on each other for food. However, studying these interactions is not easy because they can be hard to observe and can happen at different times and places. Imagine trying to watch animals talk to each other in the wild, it’s not that simple! My research centers around the use of computational methods to figure out these interactions using available biological information. My work comprises three main projects. First, recognizing the variability of these interactions, I am reviewing different ideas about the concept of chance when it comes to the uncertainty of species interactions (stochastic web project). Second, I use a principle called “maximum entropy” to predict and understand the organization of complex networks formed by the aggregation of these interactions (maximum entropy project). Third, I use different numerical tools to figure out which species interact with each other (network prediction project). Throughout my graduate studies, I also engaged in various projects related to biodiversity, ecological networks, and data science, participating in different working groups and internships.\n\n\n\nBiodiversity extends beyond the mere presence of species in a particular location and timeframe. It encompasses the intricate interactions between them, such as their relationships of predation, pollination, and parasitism. These interconnections are an essential component of biodiversity that demands careful documentation and protection.\n\n\n\n\n My hobbies and interests\nIn my spare time, I’ve become an avid walker, an occasional jogger (follow my progress on  Strava!), and an amateur but enthusiastic ping-pong player. I find joy in hiking and playing all sorts of racket sports like tennis, badminton, and squash. I also like strategic board games and chess (play with me and be my friend on  lichess). In my leisure time, I delve into urban and historical fictions (find me on  goodreads) and pursue learning new languages, currently focusing on Spanish and Hindi. Another enjoyable activity of mine is cooking (feel free to share your best vegan recipes with me), all the while listening to the captivating tunes of Styx, Supertramp, and Tears For Fears.\n\n\n\nI lost my car keys during one of our lab retreats north of Montreal. When I got back to my place thanks to my generous family who came to rescue me, I shamefully found them at the bottom of my second pair of shoes.\n\n\n\nFor more information about what I do, see IVADO Student Portraits."

    "title": "Forecasting biodiversity: Our internship experience with GEO BON",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We recently completed a two-month internship with The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON). Its headquarters having recently moved to Montreal, we immediately wanted to be part of this new chapter by contributing to a project as exciting as it is ambitious: an integrated biodiversity information system. GEO BON is indeed currently developing such an information system that would, among other things, provide real-time estimates of many biodiversity indicators at the planetary scale. Another purpose of GEO BON’s information system is to facilitate the conduction of biodiversity forecasts under different socioeconomic scenarios and enhance the plausibility and precision of these models.\nWhen implemented, this tool could be highly valuable for both the scientific community and environmental managers alike. Unlike our enthusiasm and excitement for the broader project, our contribution had to be finite (!). Our role, as interns, was to develop a forecasting model of local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD), a measure of a site’s ecological uniqueness in terms of species composition, of warbler species at the regional scale. Our work served as a proof of concept for GEO BON’s project and helped identify potential pitfalls in terms of data availability and computing resources.\n\n\n\nA warbler (not identified but identifiable), unaware of all the modeling we did on its taxon.\n\n\nWarbler species have the desirable property of being objectively beautiful. They are a diversified group of colorful birds in America, which makes people appreciate collecting data on them. This is mostly why we have a lot of occurrence data on them and why we chose to model their distribution in our study. Before forecasting their distribution, we first conducted a species distribution model (SDM) with contemporary data, in order to learn how environmental and land-use data drive current species occurrence. We conducted the SDM in Quebec and Colombia, not only because of their large spatial extents, but also because they represent completely different ecosystems with different historical anthropogenic impacts. Occurrence data were taken from the eBird database, whereas environmental data (temperature and precipitation) were obtained from the Chelsa database. Land-use data, for their part, were taken from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC). We conducted our SDM separately for all species and in the two regions of interest using Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs). Next, we forecasted species distributions in 2050 and 2070 using forecasted environmental and land-use data, generated under the MIROC climate model and the RCP 6.0 scenario, as inputs to the previously trained model. Those years were chosen purely based on data availability. Warbler communities were then predicted in each grid cell by stacking all single-species predictions (stacked-SDM) for every year studied (2020, 2050, and 2070). Finally, LCBD values were directly measured on these predicted communities. You can see our results for the years 2020 and 2050 below.\n\n\n\nRelative LCBD values in Quebec (top panels) and Colombia (bottom panels) in 2020 (left panels) and 2050 (center panels). The right panels show the difference in relative LCBD between the two years.\n\n\nWe found a strong latitudinal gradient of relative LCBD differences between the two years in Quebec. Whereas warbler communities in southern Quebec are expected to become less unique (relative to all warbler communities, or grid cells, in Quebec), northern Quebec might house more unique communities in the upcoming years. We believe this might be the result of species migration to higher latitudes, as well as a homogenization of species composition in southern Quebec. Although this latitudinal gradient is not apparent in Colombia, we see how the Andes Mountains usually host more unique communities in both years, in part because of their higher species richness in comparison to surrounding areas.\nIn general, our work is promising as it shows how different data sources can be combined to forecast biodiversity indicators (here, LCBD) at large spatial scales, an important first step in the development of GEO BON’s extensive biodiversity information system. Taking a step back, we think our internship was a good methodological exercise for us, as it allowed us to find, integrate, and manipulate different types of biological and environmental data. It also enabled us to develop new modeling skills, especially related to forecasting models, that we probably wouldn’t have developed in our mostly linear academic path.\n\nThis piece of writing was the first of two blog posts on our internship experience with GEO BON, which happened in the summer of 2021. The second post discussed in more depth our learning experience regarding data availability. With this series of articles, we hoped that we sparked your enthusiasm in pursuing such a science-driven internship!\nFrancis Banville, Gabriel Dansereau and Samuel Provencher-Tardif\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{banville2021,\n  author = {Banville, Francis and Dansereau, Gabriel and\n    Provencher-Tardif, Samuel},\n  title = {Forecasting Biodiversity: {Our} Internship Experience with\n    {GEO} {BON}},\n  date = {2021-10-25},\n  url = {https://francisbanville.github.io/posts/2023-03-07-forecasting-lcbd/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBanville, Francis, Gabriel Dansereau, and Samuel Provencher-Tardif.\n2021. “Forecasting Biodiversity: Our Internship Experience with\nGEO BON.” October 25, 2021. https://francisbanville.github.io/posts/2023-03-07-forecasting-lcbd/."

We meet on a monthly basis to discuss scientific and philosophical books relevant to our field of study. With this initiative, we hope to put the “Ph” back in our PhD by fostering philosophical thinking during our doctoral degree, which tends to encourage hyper-specialization at the expense of introspection and critical thinking. Thank you Andrew, Emmanuelle, Morgan, and Stéphanie for your profound reflections and excellent selection of food and drinks. Here are some of the books we’ve read.\n\n\n\nBook 4: Les chiens ont soif by Normand Baillargeon. “De toutes les menaces qui pèsent sur la liberté, la plus grande est sans nul doute la perte de l’esprit critique. On en mesure chaque jour l’étendue dans les médias qui, ayant renoncé à cultiver l’opinion publique, préparent et adaptent les consciences aux « nouvelles réalités ». On l’observe également dans les écoles et les universités qui ont bradé leur indépendance, leur mission et leurs valeurs fondamentales, pour se mettre au pas des impératifs économiques. Face à une telle servilité intellectuelle, ce livre constitue une invitation à la trahison.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBook 3: Data Feminism by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein. “Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. In Data Feminism, Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBook 2: Pollution Is Colonialism by Max Liboiron. “In Pollution Is Colonialism, Max Liboiron presents a framework for understanding scientific research methods as practices that can align with or against colonialism. They point out that even when researchers are working toward benevolent goals, environmental science and activism are often premised on a colonial worldview and access to land. Focusing on plastic pollution, the book models an anticolonial scientific practice aligned with Indigenous, particularly Métis, concepts of land, ethics, and relations.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBook 1: Ethics and Science: An Introduction by Adam Briggle and Carl Mitcham. “Who owns your genes? What does climate science imply for policy? Do corporations conduct honest research? Should we teach intelligent design? Humans are creating a new world through science. The kind of world we are creating will not simply be decided by expanding scientific knowledge, but will depend on views about good and bad, right and wrong.”"

    "text": "Predators and prey form complex networks of energy flow that drive the functioning and dynamics of ecosystems. Because of their high number and variability, knowing all feeding relationships in food webs is very challenging, especially at large spatial and temporal scales. Fortunately, many properties of food webs can be studied without knowing every interaction by using simple computational tools. This is the case of their overall structure, which is driven by just a few ecological factors despite the large number of mechanisms shaping ecological networks. In this project, we use a mathematical framework to identify these important factors by applying a principle called “maximum entropy” to the analysis of food-web structure. With this knowledge, we can make more accurate predictions of ecological networks and better understand the relationships between predators and prey."

Maximum entropy is like having a rule that says “Use as many different colors and shapes as you can”. This means you will use all the crayons in your box to make a picture that could look like the one to the right. On the other hand, if someone told you “You can use less than ten colors”, your picture would not be as complex and would look more like the one to the left. That would be like having low entropy, where you have limited options for your picture. Our framework is based on the assumption that food webs are shaped in a way that allows for the most possibilities of network organizations (or options) to occur."

    "text": "The stochastic nature of species interactions has led many biologists to adopt a probabilistic view of ecological networks. Representing species interactions probabilistically (how likely are they to interact?) as opposed to deterministically (do they interact?) allows a better assessment of their spatiotemporal variability and accounts for inherent uncertainties in observations and predictions. However, despite this growing interest in probabilistic networks, general guidelines regarding the estimation and documentation of probabilistic interaction data are still lacking. In this project, we review how probabilistic interactions are defined in the literature at different spatial scales, from local networks of realized interactions to regional networks of potential interactions (metawebs). We show that different network representations have different statistical behaviours when it comes to common ecological applications."
