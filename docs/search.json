    "text": "Artificial intelligence can be used to classify the full set of predation relationships within a biological community. Without it, such a task would be difficult if not inconceivable. Networks made up of predators and their prey are core elements in the operation and stability of every ecosystem, and can be reconstituted based on the total number of species present. But for what purpose? To better protect them. \n\nBluefin tuna is a staple of the diets of millions of people. It feeds mainly on small fish, which in turn feed on plankton. The decline of a one species within that food chain could have dramatic consequences for bluefin populations, which are already severely affected by commercial fishing. This is a simplified illustration, however, and it paints a somewhat misleading ecological picture. Every biological community comprising a given set of species, aquatic or terrestrial, actually includes multiple interconnected food chains, which, taken together, amount to a network. Such networks, weakened because of human activity, underpin the workings of all ecosystems.\nWithin these so-called trophic networks, or food webs, two species are linked if they interact. Predators derive energy from feeding on their prey, and through that energy, they play a crucial role in maintenance of the benefits we as humans receive from the environment. Those benefits are indispensable, of course: food chains provide considerable services to humankind every year. To that end, proper protection of ecosystems requires a thorough understanding of their trophic networks. Accounting for all the interactions between species in a given place, however, demands considerable human and financial resources. For example, determining whether a jackal interacts with an antelope in a given natural setting may require several hours of painstaking work. Data collected on trophic networks are therefore limited, posing a major obstacle to studying them on a large scale.\nThe objective of my research project, given the scarcity of data on predation relationships, is to develop a method for predicting how interactions in a trophic network are organized. To do so, I use the total number of species within a biological community, which is by far the most studied and quantified measure of biodiversity in ecology. Estimates of total species counts in a network are generally accurate, even when not all species have been identified.\nMyriad ecological issues can therefore be explored without knowing the exact identity of predators and prey. Ecologists often focus on the way interactions are organized within a biological community to understand how it functions. For example, an invasive species generally has more difficulty becoming part of a network in which species interact a lot with each other; that is, a network that is virtually saturated with interactions. The total number of interactions in a network is thus a primary source of information about its stability and resilience to natural disruptions. Many other aspects of trophic network structure are also factors in the functioning of biological communities; for example, the presence of groups of species whose members interact extensively with each other. By accurately predicting the structure of food webs, we can thus better study the consequences of environmental disasters on the functioning of ecosystems.\nThe number of species is a fundamental measure of any trophic network, as it is also closely associated with the total number of interactions. A community with a high number of species typically has an even higher number of interactions. With my research team, I modelled this association while controlling for ecological constraints on the minimum and maximum number of interactions. For example, a community composed exclusively of a herbivore that feeds on a few plant species would have the minimum number of interactions, while one made up of cannibalistic carnivores—that is, a community saturated in interactions—would have the maximum number of interactions. Between these two extremes, a fraction of the potential interactions occurs. We therefore modelled the probability that a given interaction would happen.\nAfter a large number of simulations, we obtained the total number of predicted interactions within a network. As an example, take Mount Royal Park, on the Island of Montréal. According to the group Les amis de la montagne (friends of the mountain), it is home to no fewer than 700 plant species, 180 avian species, and 20 mammalian species. The total number of interactions in this trophic network made up of 900 species, approximately 65,000, can be predicted using our model.\nAlthough the total number of interactions is itself informative, it is also linked to the way in which those interactions are organized within a given network. The next phase of my research project will therefore harness the results obtained thus far to more specifically predict the organizational structure of the links within a trophic network based on the number of species and the predicted number of interactions. The significant biodiversity loss resulting from environmental disasters may drastically alter the functioning of ecosystems by modifying the structure of their trophic networks. I therefore aim to use the results of my project to pave the way for better simulation of the consequences of climate change and natural-habitat destruction on trophic networks, so as to identify effective measures for limiting those harmful impacts.\n\nThis article was produced by me with the guidance of Marie-Paule Primeau, science communication advisor, as part of IVADO’s “My research project in 800 words” initiative.\nFind some of my videos on IVADO’s Youtube channel!\nMon projet de recherche IVADO en 800 mots\nFirst Estimates of Food Web Structure Derived from Species Richness\nOctobre Numérique IVADO 2020\nThe original version of this blog post can be found on IVADO’s website.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We recently completed a two-month internship with The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON). Its headquarters having recently moved to Montreal, we immediately wanted to be part of this new chapter by contributing to a project as exciting as it is ambitious: an integrated biodiversity information system. GEO BON is indeed currently developing such an information system that would, among other things, provide real-time estimates of many biodiversity indicators at the planetary scale. Another purpose of GEO BON’s information system is to facilitate the conduction of biodiversity forecasts under different socioeconomic scenarios and enhance the plausibility and precision of these models.\nWhen implemented, this tool could be highly valuable for both the scientific community and environmental managers alike. Unlike our enthusiasm and excitement for the broader project, our contribution had to be finite (!). Our role, as interns, was to develop a forecasting model of local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD), a measure of a site’s ecological uniqueness in terms of species composition, of warbler species at the regional scale. Our work served as a proof of concept for GEO BON’s project and helped identify potential pitfalls in terms of data availability and computing resources.\n\n\n\nA warbler (not identified but identifiable), unaware of all the modeling we did on its taxon.\n\n\nWarbler species have the desirable property of being objectively beautiful. They are a diversified group of colorful birds in America, which makes people appreciate collecting data on them. This is mostly why we have a lot of occurrence data on them and why we chose to model their distribution in our study. Before forecasting their distribution, we first conducted a species distribution model (SDM) with contemporary data, in order to learn how environmental and land-use data drive current species occurrence. We conducted the SDM in Quebec and Colombia, not only because of their large spatial extents, but also because they represent completely different ecosystems with different historical anthropogenic impacts. Occurrence data were taken from the eBird database, whereas environmental data (temperature and precipitation) were obtained from the Chelsa database. Land-use data, for their part, were taken from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC). We conducted our SDM separately for all species and in the two regions of interest using Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs). Next, we forecasted species distributions in 2050 and 2070 using forecasted environmental and land-use data, generated under the MIROC climate model and the RCP 6.0 scenario, as inputs to the previously trained model. Those years were chosen purely based on data availability. Warbler communities were then predicted in each grid cell by stacking all single-species predictions (stacked-SDM) for every year studied (2020, 2050, and 2070). Finally, LCBD values were directly measured on these predicted communities. You can see our results for the years 2020 and 2050 below.\n\n\n\nRelative LCBD values in Quebec (top panels) and Colombia (bottom panels) in 2020 (left panels) and 2050 (center panels). The right panels show the difference in relative LCBD between the two years.\n\n\nWe found a strong latitudinal gradient of relative LCBD differences between the two years in Quebec. Whereas warbler communities in southern Quebec are expected to become less unique (relative to all warbler communities, or grid cells, in Quebec), northern Quebec might house more unique communities in the upcoming years. We believe this might be the result of species migration to higher latitudes, as well as a homogenization of species composition in southern Quebec. Although this latitudinal gradient is not apparent in Colombia, we see how the Andes Mountains usually host more unique communities in both years, in part because of their higher species richness in comparison to surrounding areas.\nIn general, our work is promising as it shows how different data sources can be combined to forecast biodiversity indicators (here, LCBD) at large spatial scales, an important first step in the development of GEO BON’s extensive biodiversity information system. Taking a step back, we think our internship was a good methodological exercise for us, as it allowed us to find, integrate, and manipulate different types of biological and environmental data. It also enabled us to develop new modeling skills, especially related to forecasting models, that we probably wouldn’t have developed in our mostly linear academic path.\n\nThis piece of writing was the first of two blog posts on our internship experience with GEO BON, which happened in the summer of 2021. The second post discussed in more depth our learning experience regarding data availability. With this series of articles, we hoped that we sparked your enthusiasm in pursuing such a science-driven internship!\nFrancis Banville, Gabriel Dansereau and Samuel Provencher-Tardif\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{banville2021,\n  author = {Francis Banville and Gabriel Dansereau and Samuel\n    Provencher-Tardif},\n  title = {Forecasting Biodiversity: {Our} Internship Experience with\n    {GEO} {BON}},\n  date = {2021-10-25},\n  url = {https://francisbanville.github.io/posts/2023-03-07-forecasting-lcbd/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nFrancis Banville, Gabriel Dansereau, and Samuel Provencher-Tardif. 2021.\n“Forecasting Biodiversity: Our Internship Experience with GEO\nBON.” October 25, 2021. https://francisbanville.github.io/posts/2023-03-07-forecasting-lcbd/."

    "text": "About\n\n My values\nSafeguarding the quality of the environment for the benefits of humans and animals is something close to my heart, as are issues of equity, diversity and inclusion in academia and beyond. I am committed to making science more open and comprehensible to the general public. This to me is fundamental to addressing the greatest challenges of our time: climate change and the biodiversity crisis. To this end, I also support economic degrowth and am moving towards a more sustainable lifestyle by reducing my carbon footprint through minimalist habits and limited plane travels.\n\n\n\nI love making science memes! This is a very efficient way to communicate and share our passion for science.\n\n\n\n\n My academic journey\nAfter spending nearly two years studying mathematics, I decided to switch to biology. I wanted to deepen my understanding of the environmental issues we face today. A little later, I eventually merged these two interests by starting a professional master’s in quantitative and computational biology. This enabled me to develop my programming skills and familiarize myself with the use of digital methods in ecology. These skills were invaluable to me when I started my scientific journey as a PhD student in biology.\n\n\n\nI made this hypnotizing GIF in one of my Master’s projects, in which we reproduced the classical paper of Hastings and Powell (1991). It shows how the temporal dynamics of a three-species food chain slowly takes the shape of an alluring tea cup.\n\n\n\n\n My coding motivations\nAlong my academic journey, I understood that ecology could benefit from digital intelligence by making it easier for us to study complex ecological systems. I had done very little programming before my graduate studies, so at first I shuddered at the prospect of writing a few lines of code. Then I gradually got my hands dirty, and coding is now something I really enjoy! Another motivating factor for me to work in digital intelligence is the welcoming and open community of researchers.\n\n\n\nStudying predator-prey dynamics has fostered my interests in ecological networks. Picture credit: Tanya Strydom.\n\n\n\n\n My research\nNetworks of species interactions, such as networks of predators and prey commonly called food webs, drive the functioning of ecosystems and determine their response to environmental changes. It can be difficult (or even impossible) to observe every interaction in a given environment. Yet, understanding these interactions is fundamental if we want to adequately protect ecosystems worldwide. This creates important ecological data gaps that can be partially filled using numerical predictions. My research focuses on the development of statistical and mathematical models for predicting those predator-prey relationships and some key emerging network properties in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Specifically, my main research project uses maximum entropy to predict the structure of food webs on a global scale. Take a look at the projects and publications pages to know more!\n\n\n\nA wasp lies caught on a spider web. Both animals are predators that must eat other animals to live; in this case, the wasp may or may not become food for the spider. How certain is this interaction between species? We can think of this uncertainty as a probability, and the aggregate of all such interactions among organisms in one place as a statistical distribution. Photo credit: Yves Banville.\n\n\n\n\n My priorities\nAs graduate students, we often tend to neglect our mental and physical health. Yet, maintaining the right work-life balance is one of the most important keys to success in grad school. It can’t be overstated: it’s important to eat well, get enough sleep and exercise, and have hobbies, especially when writing a PhD thesis. In my spare time, I’ve become an avid walker, an occasional jogger, and an amateur but committed ping-pong player! Universities offer psychological help, social support, and physical care to students in need. At the University of Montreal, the Services à la vie étudiante offers many tools that greatly helped me throughout my academic journey.\n\n\n\nI lost my car keys during one of our lab retreats north of Montreal. When I managed to get back to my place thanks to my generous family, I shamefully found them at the bottom of my shoes. I became a meme since then.\n\n\n\nAdapted from IVADO Student Portraits"
