I have a profound interest in understanding how living organisms interact with each other and how these relationships, good and bad, can alter our understanding of biodiversity. My love for numbers and computers have led me to develop mathematical models of food webs, which are complex networks of predators and prey. With my models, I aim to better understand the ecological drivers of species interactions, in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and predict the structure of food webs on a global scale.\nI use he/him pronouns."
